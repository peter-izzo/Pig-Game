      <h2>GAME RULES:</h2>
      <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</p>
      <p>- In each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score</p>
      <p>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
      <p>- If the player rolls two 6's in a row, his current AND round score are lost</p>
      <p>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
      <p>- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game</p>
      <p>- Players can change the final winning score using the text box at the bottom of the play area.</p>
